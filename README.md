# AI-Virtual-Assistant
I developed an AI Virtual Assistant using Python that handles tasks like answering queries, setting reminders, and fetching info. It uses SpeechRecognition for voice input, NLTK for language processing, OpenAI GPT for responses, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Tkinter for a simple interface.
